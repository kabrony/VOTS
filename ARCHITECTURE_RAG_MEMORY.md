# VOTS // DYSTOLABS – Advanced Memory & RAG/LLM Architecture

This document outlines how **continuous learning**, **advanced memory**, and **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) integrate with **LangChain**, your synergy **Python agent**, and the underlying DB or vector store (Chroma, Mongo, or otherwise). It also explains the low/mid/high logic layering.

## 1. Overview

In this **VOTS // DYSTOLABS** ecosystem:

1. **Next.js** (front-end) – The user’s synergy chat UI (dark theme).
2. **Python Agent** – Central synergy logic (calls GPT-4, Gemini).  
3. **RAG + LangChain** – Manages knowledge base retrieval + advanced chain-of-thought:
   - Could store embeddings in **Chroma** or references in **Mongo**.
4. **Rust, C, Go** microservices** – Additional specialized tasks if needed.
5. **Low / Mid / High** logic layering:
   - **Low-level** memory or local doc retrieval
   - **Mid-level** synergy combining user context with retrieved knowledge
   - **High-level** advanced reasoning or multi-agent orchestration

## 2. Data Flow for “Continuous Learning” & Memory

### 2.1 Chat Storage & Logging

- **Mongo** or **Chroma** can store the **raw chat transcripts** or tokens:
  1. Each user message and synergy response is appended to a collection (like `chat_logs`).
  2. If you want to treat it as a knowledge base, you can embed messages into vectors using OpenAI or local embeddings, then store them in **Chroma** for retrieval in future queries.

### 2.2 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

- **RAG** approach means:
  - When a user sends a prompt, your synergy code uses **LangChain** or a direct approach:
    1. **Search** relevant documents or chat logs from a vector store (like Chroma).
    2. Grab top-k relevant chunks.
    3. Append them as context to GPT-4 or Gemini, producing a “grounded” answer.
- This ensures the system gradually **builds** a knowledge base over time (e.g., developer docs, user Q&As).

### 2.3 Low / Mid / High Logic

- **Low-level**:  
  - Storing raw user messages & synergy outputs in DB. Possibly embedding them if relevant.
  - Simple retrieval (e.g., `Chroma.similarity_search(prompt, k=5)`).
- **Mid-level**:  
  - LangChain “chains” or “agents” that incorporate the user’s query + retrieved context → GPT-4 or Gemini, returning an answer.  
  - Could also do a **Rust** or **Go** microservice call for specialized tasks.
- **High-level**:  
  - A multi-agent orchestrator (e.g., the synergy agent in Python) that can route requests among GPT-4, Gemini, or local models. Possibly loop them in debate or chain-of-thought sequences (like “mid-level” results get re-fed into GPT).

## 3. Where Is It Stored?

### 3.1 Chroma (Vector DB)
- If you **use** `chromadb` (we pinned version 0.4.13 in `requirements.txt`):
  - You store embeddings of user messages or PDFs in a persistent directory or S3.  
  - At retrieval time, synergy code calls something like:
    ```python
    from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
    from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

    # set up embeddings + vectorstore
    # do .similarity_search(query)
    ```
- This allows the system to “learn” from past data.

### 3.2 Mongo (Document DB)
- If you prefer a more standard doc approach:
  - You can store entire chat logs or knowledge docs in **Mongo**.  
  - Possibly also store embeddings in separate fields.  
  - Then do a partial RAG flow by indexing them in memory or with external libraries.

### 3.3 Oracle DB?
- If you have an Oracle instance, you could store advanced data there. But typically for embeddings or real-time synergy, a lighter vector DB like Chroma or Milvus is used.

## 4. How the “Brain” Coordinates

**The synergy Python agent** is effectively the “brain orchestrator” in our architecture. It:

1. Receives user prompt from front-end (Next.js).
2. **Queries** the memory store (Chroma, Mongo, or both) for context if using RAG.
3. Calls GPT-4 or Gemini with that context for an answer.
4. Optionally calls microservices (Rust, etc.) for special tasks.
5. Returns the final synergy response.

Because each user message is **logged** and optionally embedded, the system can “learn” from interactions (meaning future queries can reference old answers). Over time, your DB or vector store grows with more knowledge.

## 5. Implementation Tips

1. **LangChain** Tools:
   - `RetrievalQA`, `ConversationalRetrievalChain`, etc. for basic RAG flow.
   - “Memory” classes to preserve conversation context if you want a single multi-turn chat that references prior user messages.

2. **Multi-agent** approach:
   - Possibly run a “**LangChain Agent**” that can call different “tools” (like “callRustService,” “callGemini,” “callOpenAI,” etc.) behind the scenes.

3. **Versioning** embeddings:
   - If you change your embeddings method or want to prune older data, keep track in your synergy code.

4. **Security**:
   - Keep your **OPENAI_API_KEY**, **GEMINI_API_KEY**, etc. in `.env`.
   - Possibly filter or chunk user data before storing if there’s PII.

## 6. Summarizing the “Perfect Architecture”

1. **Front-End**: Single synergy chat box (or multi).  
2. **Python Agent**: The “orchestrator,” calling GPT-4, Gemini, or local Rust microservices.  
3. **RAG** + **LangChain**:  
   - For advanced memory retrieval from Chroma or a doc DB.  
   - Could store embedded chat logs or domain knowledge.  
4. **Low / Mid / High** logic layers:  
   - **Low**: Data/embedding storage + retrieval  
   - **Mid**: Single chain-of-thought calls, basic synergy or partial multi-agent  
   - **High**: Multi-agent debate, iterative improvements, self-reflection  
5. **DB**:  
   - **Chroma** if vector store needed for quick similarity search.  
   - **Mongo** for general doc storage or chat logs.  
   - “**Oracle**” if you have enterprise constraints, but typically not for direct vector search.

Hence, the memory and chat are saved in your DB (Chroma or Mongo) for **continuous learning**. The synergy agent handles each new user message, looks up context in the DB, calls GPT/Gemini, and returns an answer. Over time, more data accumulates, enabling more advanced RAG.
